## Unconference

We are also going to try unconferencing again. 

On the first day we will take suggestions for informal group discussions which people can vote for or say they can turn up to. Then, on the second day, we will be splitting the room so that people can move between the speaker sessions and the unconference. 

We had some great discussions that ranged from Quarto to statistical tests to NHS-R Community branding. 

Unconferencing was a popular addition to the conference last year and to learn more about what happens we have a [podcast talk](https://nhsrcommunity.substack.com/p/nhs-r-podcast-14th-december-unconferences-6da?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) with Pawel Orzechowski from the University of Edinburgh who introduced the idea of unconferencing to us and a [blog](what-was-the-unconference.qmd) by Ben Murch on how it went at the conference.
