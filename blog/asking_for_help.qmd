To enable others to help you, you'll need to include a reprex, or reproducible example - a minimal example of the data and code you're using, so they can recreate the problem.

## Setting things up

Ctrl + F7 in RStudio will open a new source column which you can use to gather together the information you want to share in your request for help.

```{r }
library(dplyr)
library(datapasta)
```

You'll often want to include a sample of your dataframe rather than the whole thing, particularly if it's very large.

```{r }
fresh_data <- NHSRdatasets::LOS_model |> dplyr::slice_sample(n = 20) # This produces a sample dataframe of 20 randomly selected rows. slice_sample(prop=0.2) will randomly select 20% of rows
```

## Sharing your data

The base R function `dput()` produces the code to recreate your data sample.

```{r }
fresh_data |> dput()
```

or another alternative is to use df_paste() from the datapasta package.

## Editing the dataframe

You may need to edit the data before sharing it to anonymise it or remove confidential information. You could manually edit the output from dput() or df_paste.

### An alternative way to modify your data for sharing

```{r}
#create a dataframe of organisation names and aliases 
Organisation <- unique(NHSRdatasets::LOS_model$Organisation) 
length(Organisation) #checks the length of the vector Organisation 
alias <- letters[1:10] #if you want to automate this you could use letters[1:length(Organisation)] 
df <- data.frame(Organisation, alias) #combines the 2 vectors into a dataframe
```

Join the dataframe we just created to the LOS_model dataframe, select the columns we want & take a sample 10 rows, before piping it into dput() to create the code we can share.

```{r}
dplyr::left_join(NHSRdatasets::LOS_model, df) |> select(Age, alias, Death) |> slice_sample(n=10) |> dput()
```

## What should you include?

-   libraries used

-   your code and an explanation of what you're trying to achieve

-   the smallest dataset that still works

-   error messages

-   what solutions you've already tried

-   check that the code you're sharing works exactly like your original code with the issue. Sometimes you'll realise for yourself what the solution is at this point!

-   check that the code you're sharing works exactly like your original code with the issue.


Don't include:

-   anything confidential

-   any code that isn't essential to the part you're asking about
